;;; Unit tests for LOOP clause parsing
;;;
;;; Tests cover:
;;; 1. Simple variable bindings (for, as, with)
;;; 2. Parallel vs sequential bindings (AND vs successive FOR)
;;; 3. Destructuring patterns (proper lists and dotted pairs)
;;; 4. Variable vs keyword distinction (e.g., 'for' as variable in 'to for')
;;; 5. Multiple forms in initially/finally/do/doing
;;; 6. Complex iteration clauses (from/to/in/on/across)
